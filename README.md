# RCTS_Sinternship_Krishna

This project is a web application that allows users to ingest data through a form or an Excel sheet. The data is then stored in a database and can be subjected to various analytics using a Python script called via an API. The results of the analytics are also stored in the database and visualized in the front end.

## Technologies Used:

### Frontend:
*React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
*HTML/CSS: For styling and structuring the frontend components.
*Axios: For making API calls to the backend.

### Backend:
*MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing the data and analytics results.
*Express.js: A Node.js framework for building the API endpoints.
*Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment for executing server-side code.
*Flask: A Python web framework for building the analytics API.

### Python:
*Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
*Any other libraries needed for specific analytics.

## Installation and Setup:

cd ../backend
npm install
```

2 Set up the MongoDB database:

* Install MongoDB and make sure it's running.
* Create a new database and configure the connection string in the backend.
